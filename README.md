# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle-Competition

This is a famous Titanic Machine Learning problem on Kaggle
Go through the train file to understand the how i solve this problem
I have used to two algorithms Rnadom Forest and Decision Tree (you can use one of these) to get the best possible accuracy
